    Simple REST app with Dependency Injection Design Pattern using a public API

A simple application that communicates with a Rest API which is https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com.
The application has two main functionalities, handling posts and albums.

Functionalities are described below:


1). Posts
a. Load the list of all posts
b. When choosing a single post from the list load the post data including comments left on that post

2). Albums
a. Load the list of all albums
b. When choosing a single album from the list load the album data including photos of that album. 
When a single album is opened only display thumbnails of its photos, but after opening a picture make a simple loader of the picture that shows the full quality image.
